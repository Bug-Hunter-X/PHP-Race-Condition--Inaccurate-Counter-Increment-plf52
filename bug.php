This code suffers from a race condition.  If two requests hit the `incrementCounter` function simultaneously, the counter might not be incremented correctly because the `file_put_contents` operation isn't atomic.  Two processes could read the same value, increment it independently, and then write the incremented values back, overwriting one of the increments.

```php
<?php
function incrementCounter() {
  $counter = (int) file_get_contents('counter.txt');
  $counter++;
  file_put_contents('counter.txt', $counter);
}

incrementCounter();
?>
```
